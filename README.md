I setup new PCs a lot, automating my defaults so it is easy for me to go from setup to working

Feel free to fork if you find interesting

A lot of this is automated through GitHub copilot resources

I save secrets to a bitlocker usb in order to prevent exposing secrets and fully automating tasks

let me know if you have any suggestions
